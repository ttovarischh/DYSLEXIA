      <p>Dyslexia is&nbsp;a&nbsp;learning disability that is&nbsp;not caused by&nbsp;insufficient training or&nbsp;laziness, but by&nbsp;the way the brain works. Dyslexia is&nbsp;predominantly referred to&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reading problem, but it&nbsp;can include many more difficulties because <a href="https://www.kortduce.com/STORYTELLING/LIVING-WITH-FINLEY/1" target="_blank">&laquo;In&nbsp;the medical world, they call this as&nbsp;having a&nbsp;high co-morbidity rate&raquo;</a>. This is&nbsp;why this website lists all the major problems and difficulties that a&nbsp;person with dyslexia or&nbsp;other learning disorder may have, such&nbsp;as: problems with reading, writing, coordination, memory and attention. All of&nbsp;the disorders mentioned above that are associated with these learning difficulties are caused by&nbsp;peculiarities in&nbsp;the development of&nbsp;neurons in&nbsp;brain and remain with the wearer for life in&nbsp;one or&nbsp;another form.</p>

      <p class="descr">When dyslexia is&nbsp;on, the text begins to&nbsp;change, the letters jump randomly from place to&nbsp;place. This is&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;the wrong comparison of&nbsp;letters with their sounds. There can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;situation, that re-reading multiple times can lead to&nbsp;seeing a&nbsp;completely new word each time you read&nbsp;it.</p>
      <p id="no_mess">Dyslexia is&nbsp;mainly a&nbsp;problem with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZytiaj32CQ" target="_blank">words</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dyscalculia.org/dyscalculia/what-s-dyscalculia" target="_blank">numbers</a> processing (there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;separate name for problem with numbers, dyscalculia). In&nbsp;the context of&nbsp;reading the main problem is&nbsp;<a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/dyslexia.html" target="_blank">recognizing phonemes</a>, this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;difficulty in&nbsp;matching a&nbsp;sound to&nbsp;the letter that this sound represents correctly. It&nbsp;occurs most often with letters that look alike such as&nbsp;d, b, p&nbsp;and&nbsp;q.
        This causes the substitution of&nbsp;letters, repetition or&nbsp;skipping of&nbsp;words and other <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5seJ_PbKMY" target="_blank">visual changes</a>. The result is&nbsp;that dyslexics spend more time reading than non-dyslexics.

      <p>The personal zine is&nbsp;an&nbsp;extension of&nbsp;the website as&nbsp;it&nbsp;shows the experience of&nbsp;one dyslexic, namely the author of&nbsp;the site. The aim of&nbsp;the zine is&nbsp;not to&nbsp;convey an&nbsp;accurate illustration of&nbsp;what all dyslexics see when they look at&nbsp;the text. The author seeks to&nbsp;make the reading process more difficult for the non-dyslexic, through visual techniques, based on&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the difficulties she encounters in&nbsp;reading. The zine is&nbsp;therefore solely the author&rsquo;s interpretation of&nbsp;dyslexia. Readers are invited to&nbsp;read an&nbsp;interpreted version of&nbsp;Hans Christian Andersen&rsquo;s tale of&nbsp;the ugly duckling. This particular fairy tale was chosen because the duckling had differences from the others, and these differences were the reason for the derogatory treatment. Often people with dyslexia find themselves in&nbsp;the similar situations.</p>
